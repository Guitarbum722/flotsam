.SH SYNOPSIS
flotsam [COMMAND]
.SH DESCRIPTION
flotsam is project generator for C applications and libraries as well as a dependency manager.  flotsam is also a build manager where it can build your project in accordance with the dependencies. 

When running flotsam to create a new project, a new directory is create and initialized to a new git repository.  It's then filled with the requisite files based on the parameter of --bin or --lib.  The only difference between the 2 options in terms of file generation is that with --bin a main.c is generated. With --lib a header file is created with the same name as the project.
